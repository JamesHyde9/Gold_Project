Customer Report
==============================================================================
Purpose:
	- This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors
    
Highlights:
	1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
    2. Segments customers into catagories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
    3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
		- total orders
        - total sales
        - total quantaty purchased
        - lifespan (in months)
	4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
		- recency (months since last order)
        - average order value (AOR)
        - average monthly spend
